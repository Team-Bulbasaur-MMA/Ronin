    <p>I’m a Software Developer with a background in military police. I decided to do a shift in careers because I wanted a more challenging but rewarding career and career in which I could make my own path. I chose programming because I knew nothing about it other than it was a skill that could be learned and Seattle has a growing tech industry that I knew I should try to take advantage of. The more I learn and use my skills, the more excited I get about my career and my future to come in tech. The thing that excites me the most about tech is the opportunity it brings and the incredible people that follow it.I’m looking to join a team where we can collaborate, grow and become the best versions of ourselves.</p>
